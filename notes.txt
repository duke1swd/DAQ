See 28pins.txt for PIC pinout.

External connectors:
 3 4-pin AMP connectors for sensors
 1 4-pin AMP connector for 2 isolated digital inputs
 1 4-pin AMP connector for USB

Connections from the board to external I/O are made through
screw terminals with two exceptions.  The SD card plugs into
a surface mount holder.  The USB connector on the board is
standard USB jack.

 Power inside the box or external through a connector?

Controls
 Mode switch (at last 5 positions, 6 prefered)

 Run/Stop switch
 Execute (reset) button
 Power switch

The mode switch's position is designed to be wired as a set of
resistors and sensed with an analog input.  Ideally position 0,
boot from USB, will produce a voltage that corresponds to logic
level 0, while all other positions will be different voltages,
all at logic level 1.  The idea to allow the USB boot loader
to sense this pin in digital mode.  This is requested because
the boot loader is short on program memory space.

If this is hard to do or unreliable I'll find a way to fit a
few more instructions into the boot loader.
