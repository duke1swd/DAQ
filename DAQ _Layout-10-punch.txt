- U6, the top pin is shorted to ground when it shouldn't be,
  and the bottom pin is completely open.  Should be grounded.

- The precision regulators behave a bit wierdly with no load.
  Adding a 10K load to +/- Excite stabilizes them.  So, apparently
  does adding in the trim pots.

- Need to verify the USB pull-ups.  Is it OK to have these installed?
  What happens when the device is removed but still has load on the bus?

- Trim pots need to be wired in when a precision voltage reference is available.

- Move the .01 filter caps (C16 and C24) need to move because they are too close
  to other caps.

- The PIC xtal is too close to the PIC.

- Update to revision #1.1.
