This program allows for quick operational checks of the sensors.

Initialization:
  Blink both LEDs at 12 HZ 5 times.

It loops forever.

If either opto isolator is on then it lights the red LED.

If any sensor changes by 2 or more from the average of its last 10
samples then that sensor number (numbered 0, 1, 2) is blinked on the
green LED.  Sensor zero is signaled by a long dash.

The signaling device (on raw0) is the OR of the two LEDs plus the
record stop switch.

NOTE 1: Analog input not yet implemented.  

NOTE 2:  If Very Quick Check (VQC) mode the analog sensors are
not sampled.  Only Opto isolators and record/stop are sampled.
LEDs and RAW-0 are still driven.  In the current NYI state this
means that RAW-0 is only driven off the red LED.


NOTE 3:
At the moment, not much of this is implemented.

In VQC mode, the RED LED tracks RECORD/STOP,
the GREEN LED blinks,
and RAW_0 tracks the binary OR of RECORD/STOP, OPT_0, and OPT_1

VQC mode is available as DAQ mode 6
