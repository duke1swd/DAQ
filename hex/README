This program takes a hex file for a PIC 18 and converts
it to a binary format.

This program is intended to pre-process images that are intended
for the simple FAT bootloader used by the Hybridsky.com data
capture board.

The input format is described here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.hex

The output format is a series of 512 byte records.

The first record is the header.

Byte 0: Magic number.  Must be 0x44
Byte 1: Magic number.  Must be 0x55

Byte 2: Program ID number.
Byte 3: Program version number.

Byte 4: Load Address, high order 8 bits.
Byte 5: Load Address, low order 8 bits.

Byte 6: Count of 512-byte data records that follow.
Byte 7: Number of 16-bit words in the last record.

Bytes 8 through 511:  Reserved, but be zero.

The remaining records are binary data to be loaded into memory.

The boatloader reserves the right to require fixed values for the load
address bytes.

If the program number does not match what is expected the boot loader
will abort.

If the program number and version number match what is already loaded
the boot loader will execute the program without reloading it.
