This directory containts a program that allows use of the DAQ
to test a deep-cycle 12V marine battery.

It runs in the DAQ 1.0 board.

Functional specification:

Connections:
INPUT 0 is the current sense.
INPUT 1 is the voltage sense.
RAW 0 is the control.  Not inverted.

Outboard hardware

This board is designed to operate in conjunction with a modest
collection of outboard hardware.  That hardware provides the load,
a current shunt, a voltage divider, and a power MOSFET that turns it
on and off.

The program turns on the load, measures current and voltage over
time, and then turns off the load when the voltage drops to a
preset minimum.

The program has these phases:

 0)  Initialize.  The bootstrap blinks the count (7) on the green LED.
     The program then sets both LEDs on for about 1 second.

 1)  Analyze the file system.  Find the location to put the data.
     Set the last modified time of the file to the current time.

     During this phase the green LED is on.

 2)  Verify that data region is erased and ready.

     If no other programs have run
     since the last time it was erased, and if we never
     captured data the last time we ran, we are good.

 3)  Wait for the record/stop switch.   Green LED flashes at just
     under 1HZ.

 4a) Write the header of the file, including time stamp.  Turn on
     the load.
 4b) Data run, gather data, write to dataflash.
     Green LED is blinking rapidly.  ~10Hz.
 4c) Monitor the voltage.  If it drops below a preset level, stop.
     Turn off the load.

 5) Finish up.  Either the voltage trigger was hit, or ran out of
    space.  If record-stop switch was turned off, write the EOF record.

    Green LED is blinking 0.1 second on, 1.3 seconds off.  If the
    recording terminated by EOF then the red LED also blinks at the
    frequency and half the duty cycle.
