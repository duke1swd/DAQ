The simplified version of the data capture board has three controls
and a single LED display.

The controls are power switch, record switch, and record button.

Normal operation sequence:

 1. Record switch off, record button up (open).
 2. Turn power switch on.
 3. Idle: LED on solid for 0.5 seconds, then a .1 second blink every second.
 4. To start recording, press and hold the record button, turn on record switch.
 5. Recording: LED .8 second blink every second.
 6. To stop recording, turn off record switch.
 7: Idle: LED blink: 1 second on / 1 second off.
 8: Power off to remove memory card.

Errors:

There are two classes of error conditions.  Operator errors
and internal errors.  Most of the internal errors are communication
problems with the MMC card.

Most errors are blinked out on the LED.  The error blink pattern is:
2 seconds off
1 second on
1 second off
error code, count the number of blinks.  Each blink is .25 on / .25 off.

Error codes:
	0: not used
	1: Record switch found on at power up.
	2: Record switch turned on when record button not on.
	3: Record button pressed while in terminal idle state.
	4: Record switch turned on while in terminal idle state.
	5: not used
	6:

If the LED is solid on, then either the controller hung with the
LED in the ON state or the software hit an unrecoverable abort state.
The abort code should be present on pin 0.

Abort conditions are
	unknown high priority interrupt
	unexpected chip reset (any reset other than power on)
