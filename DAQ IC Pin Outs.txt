Pinout for proposed 18F2455 / 18F2550 implementation.

Pins 1-14 are on the left side of the chip, presumed to face
towards the analog side of the board.  Pins 28-15 are on the
right side of the chip and are used for digital functions.

External Connections.
MCLR	MCLR is an inverted signal.  Should be held high,
	pushing button brings it to logic 0.

RA0	Mode select switch is a rotory switch with multiple
	positions.  The switch is wired with 10K resistors to
	act like a crude potentiometer between VSS and VDD.
	Center tap comes out to the PIC pin.

RA1	Record/Stop switch is SPST.  In "stop" mode the switch
	is open and the signal is logic 0 (pulled down through
	a 10K resistor).  In record mode the switch is closed,
	and the signal is logic 1.

RA2,3	The LEDs are directly driven from the PIC, which
	provides 5 volts at up to 25 milliamps.
	
RA4	Raw pins come out to a screw terminal.	The terminal
RB5	should be a pair, pin and ground.  If the pin is not
	in use then a wire should connect the pin to ground.
